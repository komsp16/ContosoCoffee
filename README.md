# ContosoCoffee - Power Platform
This solution has been built by following the Learning path on Microsoft Learn Labs for Power Platform. I am incorporating CI/CD using github workflow actions, secrets & PAC CLI.
The learning path can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/power-apps-online-workshop/

The application user interface and interaction logic are built in Power Apps, the approval workflow is automated using Power Automate, and the machine order data is stored in Microsoft Dataverse.
